## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“PRINT NUMBERS RANGE FROM M TO N

###  Aim
To write a Python Program to print numbers range from M to N (including M and N values)

---

###  Algorithm

1.Start

2.Input the starting number M

3.Input the ending number N

4.Repeat the following steps from i = M to i = N:

5.Print the value of i

6.Increment i by 1

7.End

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
for i in range(a,b+1):
print(i)
```
