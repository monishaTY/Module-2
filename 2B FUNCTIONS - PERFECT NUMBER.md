## FUNCTIONS - PERFECT NUMBER

### AIM  
To write a Python program to check if a number is a Perfect number using the concept of functions.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Begin the program.
2.Read the number n from the user using input().
3.Convert the input to an integer.
4.Define the function perfectNumber(n) with the following steps:
     Initialize a variable factor_sum to 0.
     Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n//2 (as divisors of a number can't be greater than half of it).
     If a number i divides n perfectly (i.e., n % i == 0), add i to factor_sum.
     If factor_sum is equal to n, then print the number is a perfect number. Otherwise, print it's not a perfect number.
5.Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
def perfect_num(num):
  
    sume=0  
    for i in range(1,num):  
        if (num%i==0):  
            sume=sume+i  
    if(sume==num):  
        print("The number is a Perfect number!")  
    else:  
        print("The number is not a Perfect number!") 

num=int(input())
perfect_num(num)

```
